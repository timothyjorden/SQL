# For this SQL project I analyzed a fictitious companyâ€™s database containing valuable information such as monthly sales data, customer details, and company locations. 

1. I wrote this query to determine the number of orders the company received during the month of January.
SELECT COUNT(orderID) 
  FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
  WHERE length(orderID) = 6;

2. I wrote this query to further breakdown order data from the month of January to find out how many orders were for iPhones.
SELECT COUNT(Product) iPhone_Orders
  FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
  WHERE Product = "iPhone";

3. I wrote this query to generate a list of every customer who placed an order in the month of February which contains their account 
number and their order ID number organized by descending account number.
SELECT customers.acctnum, FS.orderID
  FROM BIT_DB.customers customers
  JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales FS
  ON customers.order_id = FS.orderID
  WHERE length(orderID) = 6
  ORDER BY acctnum;

4. I wrote this query to determine what the cheapest product the company sold was in the month of January along with its price.
SELECT Product, MIN(price)
  FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
  ORDER BY price;

5. I wrote this query to catalog the products sold by the company in the month of January along with the product's corresponding total revenue generated in the month
in alphabetical order and free from empty spaces.
SELECT Product, price*Quantity AS Total_Revenue
  FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
  WHERE length(Product) > 1
  AND total_revenue > 1
  GROUP BY Product;

6. I wrote this query to determine what company products where sold at a specific location in the month of February along with the quantity sold and the total
revenue generated by each product.
SELECT Product, Quantity, SUM(Quantity)*price AS Total_Revenue
  FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
  WHERE location LIKE "%548 Lincoln St%";

7. I wrote this query to discern how many customers ordered more than two products at a time in the month of February and the average amount those customers spent.
SELECT COUNT(distinct customers.acctnum) Customers_Multiple_Products, AVG(Quantity*price) Average_Spent
  FROM BIT_DB.FebSales FS
  LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers
  ON FS.orderID = customers.order_id
  WHERE FS.Quantity > 2
  AND length(orderID) = 6;

8. I wrote this query to list every order the company received during the first weekend in February and their corresponding location.
SELECT Orderdate, Location
  FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
  WHERE orderdate BETWEEN "02/02/19 00:00" AND "02/03/19 00:00"
  ORDER BY orderdate ASC;

9. I wrote this query to congregate a list of company products and the location of which at least a quantity of five were sold in the first half of the month of March.
SELECT DISTINCT Product, Quantity, Location
  FROM BIT_DB.MarSales
  WHERE orderdate BETWEEN "03/01/19%" AND "03/15/19 00:00"
  AND Quantity >= 5
  ORDER BY location; 

10. I wrote this query to determine which products were sold and how many were sold in Los Angeles during the month of February.
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity) Quantity_Sold_in_LA
  FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
  WHERE location LIKE "%Los Angeles%"
  GROUP BY Product;

11. I wrote this query to determine which locations in New York had at least three orders in the month of January and the number of orders they received.
SELECT DISTINCT Location, COUNT(orderID) Orders_Received
  FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
  WHERE location LIKE "%NY%"
  AND LENGTH(orderid) = 6 
  AND orderid <> "Order ID"
  GROUP BY location
  HAVING COUNT(orderID) >=3
  ORDER BY location;

12. I wrote this query to determine the quantity of each type of headphone the company sold in the month of February.
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity) Quantity
  FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
  WHERE Product LIKE "%headphone%"
  GROUP BY Product;

13. I wrote this query to determine the average amount of money spent per customer account in the month of February.
SELECT SUM(quantity*price)/COUNT(cust.acctnum)
  FROM BIT_DB.FebSales FS
  LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
  ON FS.orderid=cust.order_id
  WHERE LENGTH(orderid) = 6 
  AND orderid <> "Order ID";

15. I wrote this query to determine the average quantity of products purchased per customer account in the month of February.
SELECT SUM(FS.Quantity) / COUNT(cust.acctnum)
  FROM BIT_DB.FebSales FS
  LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
  ON FS.orderID = cust.order_id;

16. I wrote this query to determine which product brought in the most revenue in the month of January along with amount of revenue it generated.
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity*price) Revenue
  FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
  GROUP BY Product 
  ORDER BY Revenue DESC
  LIMIT 1;
