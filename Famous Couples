# For this SQL project I created tables and inserted data into them pertaining to famous couples. 

1. I wrote this query to create a table called "profession".
CREATE TABLE profession (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, 
  talent_name TEXT);

2. I wrote this query to insert data into the "profession" table.
INSERT INTO profession (talent_name) VALUES
  ("Singing"),
  ("Acting"),
  ("Athlete"),
  ("Modeling");

3. I wrote this query to create a table called "famous_people".
CREATE TABLE famous_people (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, 
  name TEXT, 
  talent_id INTEGER);

4. I wrote this query to insert data into the "famous_people" table.
INSERT INTO famous_people (name, talent_id) VALUES 
  ("Ben Affleck", 2),

  ("Faith Hill", 1),
  ("Adam Levine", 1),
  ("Behati Prinsloo", 4),
  ("Ashton Kutcher", 2),
  ("Mila Kunis", 2),
  ("David Beckham", 3),
  ("Victoria Beckham", 4);

5. I wrote this query to create a table called "famous_couples". 
CREATE TABLE famous_couples (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, 
  spouse_id1 INTEGER, 
  spouse_id2 INTEGER);

6. I wrote this query to insert data into the "famous_couples" table.
INSERT INTO famous_couples (spouse_id1, spouse_id2) VALUES
  (1, 2),
  (3, 4),
  (5, 6),
  (7, 8),
  (9, 10);

7. I wrote this query to view a list of famous couples organized as Husband and Wife.
SELECT a.name Husband, b.name Wife FROM famous_couples
  JOIN famous_people a
  ON famous_couples.spouse_id1 = a.id
  JOIN famous_people b
  ON famous_couples.spouse_id2 = b.id;

8. I wrote this query to create a table that lists famous people and their primary profession.
SELECT name Name, talent_name Talent FROM famous_people
  JOIN profession
  ON famous_people.talent_id = profession.id;
