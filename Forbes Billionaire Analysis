# For this SQL project I found Forbes' 2022 list of billionaires which I imported into SQLite. I then analyzed the data using numerous aggregating and filtering commands.

1. I wrote this query to determine the average age of billionaires worth at least $10 billion.
SELECT AVG(Age)
    FROM ForbesBill22
    WHERE Networth >= 10;
  
2. I wrote this query to obtain a list of industries that billionaires have made their fortunes in and the average net worth of the billionaires within each of those industries.
SELECT Industry, ROUND(AVG(Networth),2) Avg_Net_Worth
    FROM ForbesBill22
    GROUP BY Industry
    ORDER BY ROUND(AVG(Networth),2) DESC;
    
3. I wrote this query to determine which 10 countries have the largest number of billionaires.
SELECT Country, COUNT(Name) Number_of_Billionairs
    FROM ForbesBill22
    GROUP BY Country
    ORDER BY COUNT(Name) DESC
    LIMIT 10;
  
4. I wrote this query to view all fields of data for billionaires that are worth $7.3 billion.
SELECT *
    FROM ForbesBill22
    WHERE Networth = "7.3";
    
5. I wrote this query to get a comprehensive list, without repetition, of sources that billionaires whose primary industry include the word "health" have achieved their wealth in.
SELECT DISTINCT Source
    FROM ForbesBill22
    WHERE Industry LIKE "%Health%"
    ORDER BY Source;
    
6. I wrote this query to determine the number of billionaires in France and Italy, along with their total net worth rounded to the nearest billion.
SELECT COUNT(Name) French_and_Italian_Billionaires, ROUND(SUM(Networth),0) Total_Networth
    FROM ForbesBill22
    WHERE Country = "France" OR "Italy";

7. I wrote this query to filter the dataset so that I can view key data about billionaires that are between the ages of 18 and 30.
SELECT Name, Networth, Industry, Source
    FROM ForbesBill22
    WHERE age BETWEEN "18" AND "30"
    ORDER BY Age;
    
8. I wrote this query to determine the average age of billionaires within each industry.
SELECT Industry, ROUND(AVG(Age),0)
    FROM ForbesBill22
    GROUP BY Industry
    ORDER BY ROUND(AVG(Age),0);

9. I wrote this query to get a list of billionaires whose listed source of income is Microsoft.
SELECT Name
    FROM ForbesBill22
    WHERE Source = "Microsoft";

10. I wrote this query to determine the youngest billionaire in China along with important corresponding data.
SELECT Name, MIN(Age), Networth, Source, Industry
    FROM ForbesBill22
    WHERE Country = "China";
