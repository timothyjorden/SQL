# For this SQL project I extracted a database from Kaggle that contains various information pertaining to the pay of San Francisco city employees.
   
1. I wrote this query to view all data contained within the database
SELECT * FROM SFSal.Salaries;

2. I wrote this query to determine the ten job titles of San Fransisco employees who have the highest average total pay.
SELECT JobTitle, AVG(TotalPay)
    FROM SFSal.Salaries
    GROUP BY JobTitle
    ORDER BY AVG(TotalPay) DESC
    LIMIT 10;
   
3. I wrote this query to categorize total pay amounts into 5 levels then view San Francisco city employee job titles that contain fire or police with their appropriate pay category.
SELECT JobTitle Job_Title,
    CASE
        WHEN AVG(TotalPay) > 250000 THEN "Very Above Average"
        WHEN AVG(TotalPay) > 100000 THEN "Above Average"
        WHEN AVG(TotalPay) > 50000 THEN "Average"
        WHEN AVG(TotalPay) > 25000 THEN "Below Average"
        ELSE "Very Below Average"
    END AS "Pay_Category"
    FROM SFSal.Salaries
    WHERE JobTitle LIKE "%fire%" OR "%police%"
    GROUP BY JobTitle;
    
4. I wrote this query to determine how many San Francisco city employees make more than $250,000 a year in total pay.
SELECT COUNT(TotalPay)
    FROM SFSal.Salaries
    WHERE TotalPay > 250000;
    
5. I wrote this query to gather a comprehensive list of employees, listed alphabetically, whose base pay is between $35,000 and $35,500.
SELECT EmployeeName
    FROM SFSal.Salaries
    WHERE BasePay BETWEEN 35000 AND 35500
    ORDER BY EmployeeName;
    
6. I wrote this query to obtain a list of nursing positions with the City of San Fransisco and their average base pay.
SELECT JobTitle, AVG(BasePay)
    FROM SFSal.Salaries
    WHERE JobTitle LIKE "%nurse%"
    GROUP BY JobTitle;
    
7.  I wrote this query to determine the highest total pay of a San Francisco city employee included within the database along with their name and job title.
SELECT EmployeeName, JobTitle, MAX(TotalPay)
    FROM SFSal.Salaries;
    
8. I wrote this query to discover the pay information of a particular San Francisco city employee.
SELECT * 
    FROM SFSal.Salaries
    WHERE EmployeeName = "MARIA BEE";
    
9. I wrote this query to determine the number of distinct job titles there are with the city of San Francisco.
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT JobTitle)
    FROM SFSal.Salaries;
    
10. I wrote this query to see how the average base pay and total pay across San Francisco city employees adjusted over the years contained within the database.
SELECT Year, AVG(BasePay), AVG(TotalPay)
    FROM SFSal.Salaries
    GROUP BY Year;
